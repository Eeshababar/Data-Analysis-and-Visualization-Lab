        "# What is text pre-processing?\n",
        "\n",
        "Text pre-processing is the process of transforming unstructured text to structured text to prepare it for analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you pre-process text before feeding it to algorithms, you increase the accuracy and efficiency of said algorithms by removing noise and other inconsistencies in the text that can make it hard for the computer to understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "Making the text easier to understand also helps to reduce the time and resources required for the computer to pre-process data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Processes involved in text pre-processing\n",
        "To properly pre-process your text and get it in the right state to perform further analysis and actions with it, there are quite a few operations that need to be done on the text and a couple of steps to be followed to get a well structured text.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Tokenization\n",
        "Tokenization is the first stage of the process.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here your text is analysed and then broken down into chunks called ‘tokens’ which can either be words or phrases. This allows the computer to work on your text token by token rather than working on the entire text in the following stages.\n",
        "\n",
        "The two main types of tokenisation are word and sentence tokenisation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Word tokenisation is the most common kind of tokenisation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, each token is a word, meaning the algorithm breaks down the entire text into individual words:"
